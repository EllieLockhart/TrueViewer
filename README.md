# TrueViewer
 A React/Node web app system, with browser plugins and other forms of (user-informed) data generation designed to automate the tracking of film and television viewing for analytic and recommendation purposes.
 
 **Very much in early development status, *do not attempt to use in production!***
 
 ## Project Goals & Scope
 The collection of data about user activity online is frequently scapegoated or viewed as a user-hostile or ethically questionable endeavour. Yet many users praise the outcome of at least one such data gathering enterprise: Netflix's recommendations engine, which has produced many a happy evening (or full day!) of "binging" by suggesting entertainment content a user may enjoy based on their past activity. Unfortunately, this is not a very helpful feature for users when they run out of content on Netflix or want to know if something is likely to be "up their alley" and they have discovered it elsewhere.
 
 It is the belief of this developer that the tight holding of data as a corporate secret, practiced by companies with deep predictive algorithms, is understandable and commercially justifiable, but ultimately unhelpful to end users. It may also help generate public sentiment against data collection, even against data such as film viewing which is generally "safe" to collect. The goal of TrueViewer is to create an open-source framework as a basis for a deployable web app (which could be free software or commercial) offering accurate recommendations for films (and possibily television) for users based on their past activity, shared with their knowledge and understanding; and to create a (again, with user consent) robust framework for research based on this data which will allow, for instance, quantitative comparison between user reactions to Netflix original content and Hulu original content.
 
 This project is ambitious and requires several components to functions; there are additional challenges that will prevent it from fully replicating even the base information available to a company like Netflix, although with collaboration, I believe that this is a solvable problem.
